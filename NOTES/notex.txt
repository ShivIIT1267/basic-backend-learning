// notes about cors

// cors means cross origin

// two application working in differnt ports do have
cross origin or effectively different origin

any web does not allow front end from another port to take the data from our thing,

so we introduce cors, where we decide which can take and which cannot


// concept of proxy : 

we have servers in the front end
it is not taking responses or requests from the backend serveer knowing it is from diffrent origin

// but in the front end we set up proxy, so 
according to proxy, req and res is done from backend using proxy and backend thinks it is coming from same origins

// it helps it easier to handle long urls

// we will change the proxy value in the vite.config.js as soon as we change our servers


// How are you fetching from the backend to show it into the fronend.

// we use methods such as fetch methods or axios to take the data from backend 

useEffect(() => {
    axios
      .get("/api/jokes")  // gets from the required url
      .then((response) => {
        setJokes(response.data);  // makes the data accoding to the response data and then can be shown using frontend
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  });


// data modelling in mongodB and use of mongobB

ORM and ODM : Object relational mapping and object document mapping, these are two ways to communicate with the 
databases 
depending on how the data is stored, we use ORM or ODM ,

some databases store in the form of tables rows and columns like sql, so we use ORM for them while some of them use, 
JSON format documnents collection, so we use it accordingly


in MongoDb it is stored in the document form and we use ODM language mongoose for interaction with it

why mongoDB : we can use complex data structures, to be stored in nested formats, 

üü© ODM is better when:
You want rapid, flexible development.

Data structure is nested or unstructured.

Schema changes often.

üü• ORM is better when:
You need strict consistency.

You have complex relationships between data.

Your schema is stable and well-defined.


// see example of hospital management the way we created the user model,

what is modelling : 

for any software designing it requires, the modelling of the databases, like all the data that will be stored in it
the schema of all of this is called data modelling

majorly parts of a backend : 

üìÅ controllers/
What: Functions that handle logic for each route.

Purpose: Act as the brain ‚Äî process input, call models, return responses.

Example: createUser, getAllHospitals


databases/
What: DB connection config and setup.

Purpose: Central place to connect to MongoDB or other databases.

Example: mongoose.connect(...) lives here.


middlewares/
What: Functions that run before reaching controllers.

Purpose: For auth checks, error handling, request logging, etc.

Example: verifyToken, errorHandler


models/
What: Mongoose schemas and models.

Purpose: Define the structure of your MongoDB documents.

Example: User.js, Hospital.js

// ROUTERS
What: Defines HTTP endpoints and maps them to controllers.

Purpose: Handles URLs and HTTP methods.

Example: router.post("/signup", signupController)

UTILITY FUNCTIONS : 
What: Utility/helper functions.

Purpose: Reusable logic that doesn't belong in models/controllers.

Example: generateToken, sendEmail, formatDate


// await async thing : 

synchronous code : when the code runs and wait for each and every file to complete its tasks,this is called synchronous code

asynchronous code : when code runs and it do runs other things such as api calls and other things in the background and also keep perfoming other tasks in the backside, then it is called as asynchronous manner


// while dealing with api's what happens is that it is a time consuming process and hence we use async await, which makes it more efficient.

 Does async/await make code faster?
 No ‚Äî async/await itself does not make operations faster.

Instead, it makes your program more efficient by allowing:

Other code to run while waiting for time-consuming tasks.

Avoiding blocking the main thread (especially important in browsers or servers).

// something about .env and environment variables

.env are the environmet variables, which are to be used to store the configuration data

// like port to run,passes,and API keys and secrets

dotenv is an npm package which reads the .env file and loads those variables in the process.env, so can be used in the code as earliest as possible
